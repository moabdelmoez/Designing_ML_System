ML systems design takes a system approach to MLOps, which means that we’ll consider an ML system holistically to ensure that all the components—the business requirements, the data stack, infrastructure, deployment, monitoring, etc.—and their stakeholders can work together to satisfy the specified objectives and requirements.

Before we develop an ML system, we must understand why this system is needed. If this system is built for a business, it must be driven by business objectives, which will need to be translated into ML objectives to guide the development of ML models.

But the truth is: most companies don’t care about the fancy ML metrics. They don’t care about increasing a model’s accuracy from 94% to 94.2% **unless it moves some business metrics**.

So what metrics do companies care about? While most companies want to convince you otherwise, the sole purpose of businesses, according to the Nobel-winning economist Milton Friedman, is **to maximize profits for shareholders**.
The ultimate goal of any project within a business is, therefore, to increase profits, either directly or indirectly: directly such as increasing sales (conversion rates) and cutting costs; indirectly such as higher customer satisfaction and increasing time spent on a website

Returns on investment in ML depend a lot on the maturity stage of adoption. The longer you’ve adopted ML, the more efficient your pipeline will run, the faster your development cycle will be, the less engineering time you’ll need, and the lower your cloud bills will be, which all lead to higher returns.
