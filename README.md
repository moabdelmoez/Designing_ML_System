# Designing_ML_System
This is a summary of the Designing Machine Learning System book, with some notes

One  million dollar question is; How to deploy ML models at your organization???

These questions can be generic, such as 
  * What model should I use?
	* How often should I retrain my model?
	* How can I detect data distribution shifts?
	* How do I ensure that the features used during training are consistent with the features used during inference?‚Äù

The short answer to all of these questions is always : "It depends!!!"

ML systems are both complex and unique. 
They are complex because they consist of many different components (ML algorithms, data, business logic, evaluation metrics, underlying infrastructure, etc.) and involve many different stakeholders (data scientists, ML engineers, business leaders, users, even society at large). 

ML systems are unique because they are data dependent, and data varies wildly from one use case to the next.
